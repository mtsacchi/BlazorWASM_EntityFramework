This is only for demonstration purposes.
The MySql DB connection string and password are exceptionally stored in the code. Storing them somewhere else was out of the scope of this demo.

Schema: mypublicgithub
User: user
Password: user
Table: TestData
Columns: Id int (PK, AI), Name varchar(10), Value varchar(10)
